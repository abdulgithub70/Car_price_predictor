Regression is a statistical method used in machine learning, statistics, and data analysis to model
The relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the target) and one or more independent
variables (predictors or features). The goal of regression analysis is to understand and quantify
the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable.

Linear Regression: Linear regression models the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more
independent variables using a linear equation. It is commonly used for predicting numerical values and is one of
the most straightforward regression techniques.
    It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
    In simple linear regression, you have one independent variable and one dependent variable
    The goal is to find the values of minimize the difference between the observed values and
    the values predicted by the linear equation.
